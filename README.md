# solar_system_animation

This is a 3D interactive Solar System built using **Three.js**, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates the Sun and planets with realistic textures, orbits, and lighting. The project includes a starry background, controls for adjusting orbital speeds, pause/resume functionality, light/dark modes, and an immersive zoom-on-click feature for exploring planets up close.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need a local HTTP server because Three.js textures cannot be loaded via `file://` protocol due to browser security restrictions.

You can use:

- [VSCode Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)  
- Python built-in HTTP server:

  ```bash
  python -m http.server 8000
